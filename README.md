Created repo to demonstrate knowledge and use of flexbox.
The author of this work is Christine Ash.
I enjoyed learning this concept, however, I struggled targeting the correct items and adjusting the right margins.

Updated flexbox blog practice repo.
Learned how to create a page that is responsive to different screen sizes.
Sizes for this repo include mobile, tablet and desktop screens.
